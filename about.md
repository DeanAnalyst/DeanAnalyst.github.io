<div class="scroll-reveal">
I possess 6+ years of progressive experience in transforming complex data into actionable insights and impactful visualizations. My academic journey, culminating in an MSc in Data Analytics from the University of Portsmouth and a BA in Economics from Nottingham Trent University, has provided me with a robust toolkit for quantitative analysis and strategic thinking.

<div class="scroll-reveal">
My professional roles, notably at <b>NEC Software Solutions</b> (Housing Department) and <b>Metropolitan Thames Valley Housing</b>, have allowed me to apply these skills extensively. I've designed, developed, and maintained comprehensive BI solutions, led the creation of bespoke reports, engineered ETL processes, and built predictive models addressing critical business needs in the housing sector.

<div class="scroll-reveal">
I am passionate about the entire data lifecycle â€“ from requirements gathering and data extraction (using SQL and Python) to model building (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow) and, crucially, communicating findings through clear, interactive dashboards (Power BI, Jaspersoft, Tableau). I thrive on solving complex problems and believe that well-presented data is key to unlocking business value and driving informed decisions.

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>I believe in a pragmatic and user-centric approach to data projects. Understanding the business problem is paramount. I enjoy collaborating with stakeholders to define clear objectives and then architecting solutions that are not only technically sound but also intuitive and valuable to the end-users.</p>
